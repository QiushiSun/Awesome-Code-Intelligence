We build an evolutionary tree of CodeLMs to trace the development of code intelligence in recent years and highlight some of the most well-known models. You are free to use this figure for research, educational, knowledge-sharing, and domain background introduction purposes (just don't forget to cite us!ðŸ«¶). We welcome pull requests to refine this figure!
